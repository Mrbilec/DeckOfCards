### Summary
This is a simple card dealing program that has a few basic functionality. The first thing it does is generate a standard deck of 52 cards, this is done on program startup. All other functionality requires user input. The deal command requires two inputs, the number of hands to deal and the number of cards per hand. Dealing does not remove any cards from the deck. Dealing using the same two parameters twice in a row will show the exact same result. Shuffle will rearrange the cards in the deck. Sort will return the deck back to its original order. Exit quits the program. There is some basic error handling but it is not perfect.
